# Dingo Weather App

## Developers: Anthony Reynolds, Zumin Yu, Anthony Chung,  Hardeep Singh

### **Project Description**

As part of the Coder Academy Hackathon, we decided to build a weather app. This was an idea that won against creating a pomodoro type app that allowed the user to assign timed tasks for the day and a website show-casing student coders.

We felt a weather app would provide more of a learning curve and aswell as allow the consideration and  implementation of a greater number of features.
### **What problem does it solve?**

We wanted to create a local Australian app by Australian Developers hence the **Dingo**. The purpose of this project was to create an app that would present the local weather swiftly and accurately.

### **Features**

This app provides a hassle free, lean weather service with the main content the user wants to view easily. 

### **What did we learn?**

We chose to create a Weather App using an API so that we would have a steep learning curve and we sure did! From each other, we learnt about technologies such as imovie, pandoc, canvas, bootstrap and tailwind.

From working on the project, team members learnt about:
- Cross-origin policies
- About APIs connected to and working with the app
- Google places and the Google Map API
- Managing API key credentials and restricting access to the key


### **What makes your project stand out?**
The **barking Dingo** logo and the expediant weather stats for Australian cities on the go!

### **Technologies we used**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- Github for version control
- [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) 
- [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview)

### **Some of the challenges you faced**
- Cross-origin policies
- Managing API key credentials and restricting access to the key
- Getting bootstrap working
- Sourcing quality weather icons

### **Features you hope to implement in the future**
- Alerts
- Comparisons between multiple locations
- Weekly forecast
- A graph of temperature for the day
- Historical weather look up
